title: Tips to Remind Adherent to Your Treatment
---

* Set a reminder on your phone. Only dismiss your alarm once you have actually taken your pill! If your reminder goes off during a time when you cannot take your pill, hit snooze and your phone will remind you again later.

* Put your pill bottle somewhere you can see it every day. A good example is next to your toothbrush or coffee maker—whatever works for you.

* Make it part of one of your routine. For example:

* Morning routine: after you brush your teeth or when you drink your morning coffee.

* Meal routine: right before you eat dinner (or whatever meal you most consistently eat).

* Bedtime routine: as soon as you lay down in bed.

* Use a pillbox. This makes it easy to see when you have taken your pill and when you have not. 

* Use a calendar or a medicine journal to check off every day that you take it. It is important to check off the day the moment you take the pill. Don’t rely on your memory at the end of the day.
