**Saline** 
A saltwater solution similar to that found in IV fluids. Saline can be used to fill a breast implant.

**Schedules** 
The different combinations and timing for chemotherapy and other drugs.

**Sclerosing Adenosis** 
Small, benign (not cancer) breast lumps caused by enlarged lobules. The lumps may be felt and may be painful.

**Screening Mammogram** 
A test used to find early signs of breast cancer in a woman who does not have any known breast problems or symptoms.
 
**Second Primary Tumor** 
A second breast cancer that develops in a different location from the first. This is different from a local recurrence, which is the return of the first breast cancer.

**Selection Criteria** 
In a summary research table, the specific standards (such as study design and number of participants) a study has to meet to be included.

**Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM)** 
A drug that can either block the effects of estrogen or behave like estrogen, depending on the part of the body being treated. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are SERMs.

**Sentinel Node Biopsy** 
The surgical removal and testing of the sentinel node(s) (first axillary node(s) in the underarm area filtering lymph fluid from the tumor site) to see if the node(s) contains cancer cells.

**Silicone Gel** 
Medical-grade, solid form of silicone used for breast implants. Silicone implants can mimic the feel of a natural breast better than saline implants.

**Simple Mastectomy (see Total Mastectomy in [T](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/T/index.html))**  

**Skin-Sparing Mastectomy** 
A procedure that surgically removes the breast, but keeps intact as much of the skin that surrounds the breast as possible. This skin can then be used in breast reconstruction to cover a tissue flap or an implant instead of having to use skin from other parts of the body.

**Sonogram (see Ultrasound in [U](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/U/index.html))**  

**Stage of Cancer (Cancer Stage)** 
A way to indicate the extent of the cancer within the body. The most widely used staging method for breast cancer is the TNM system, which uses Tumor size, lymph Node status and the absence or presence of Metastases to classify breast cancers.

**Staging (Cancer Staging)** 
Doing tests to learn the extent of the cancer within the body (the cancer’s stage 0 to IV). Knowing a cancer’s stage helps determine what treatment is needed and how effective this treatment may be in getting rid of the disease and prolonging life.

**Standard Treatment (Standard of Care)** 
The usual treatment of a disease or condition currently in widespread use and considered to be of proven effectiveness on the basis of scientific evidence and past experience.

**Statistical  Significance** 
Describes whether or not the result of a study is likely due to chance. A statistically significant result likely shows a true link between a risk factor and breast cancer.

**Stereotactic Needle Biopsy** 
Core needle biopsy done with the use of stereotactic (three-dimensional) mammography guidance.

**Stereotactic Mammography** 
Three-dimensional mammography used to guide a needle biopsy.

**Supraclavicular Lymph Nodes** 
The lymph nodes above the clavicle (collarbone). See Lymph Nodes.

**Surgeon** 
Physician who performs any surgery, including surgical biopsies and other procedures related to breast cancer.

**Surgical Oncologist** 
A physician specializing in the treatment of cancer using surgical procedures.

**Survival (see Overall Survival in [O](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/O/index.html) and Relative Survival in [R](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/R/index.html))**  

**Survivor (Breast Cancer Survivor)** 
A person living with breast cancer (from the time of diagnosis).

**Survivorship** 
The emotional and physical health, life and care of a breast cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis until the end of life.
 
**Systemic (Adjuvant) Treatment** 
Treatment given in addition to surgery and radiation to treat breast cancer that may have spread to other parts of the body. It may include chemotherapy, targeted therapy and/or hormone therapy.
