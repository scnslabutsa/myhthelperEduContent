**Deductible (Insurance Deductible)** 
The pre-set amount of medical costs a person must pay before insurance payments begin.

**Definitive Surgery** 
All of the known tumor is removed and no follow-up surgery is needed.

**Diabetic Mastopathy** 
A rare benign (not cancer) breast condition that consists of small hard masses in the breast. It occurs most often in women with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes.

**Diagnosis** 
Identification of a disease from its signs and symptoms.

**Diagnostic Mammogram** 
A mammogram used to check symptoms of breast cancer (such as a lump) or an abnormal finding noted on a screening mammogram or clinical breast exam. It involves two or more X-ray views of the breast.

**Diagnostic Radiologist (Radiologist)** 
A health care provider who specializes in the diagnosis of diseases using X-rays.

**Diploid (DNA Ploidy)** 
The presence of a normal number of chromosomes in cancer cells.
 
**Disease-Free Survival Rate** 
Percent of people alive and without disease at a certain time (often five years or 10 years) after treatment Those who die from causes other than the disease under study are not included in this measure.

**Distant Recurrence (see Metastases) DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)** 
The information contained in a gene.

**Dose-Dense Therapy** 
Chemotherapy given over a shorter (more condensed) time period compared to standard therapy. The frequency of treatment sessions is increased, so the length of the treatment period is  shortened.

**Down-Staging** 
Lowering the stage of a cancer from its original stage (or the stage it was thought to be). Down-staging occurs most often after a good response to neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is chemotherapy or hormone therapy used as a first treatment (before surgery) for some large or advanced breast cancers.
Neoadjuvant therapy can shrink a tumor such that it lowers the stage of the breast cancer and a lumpectomy, instead of a mastectomy, can be done.

**Duct (Milk Duct, Mammary Duct)** 
A canal that carries milk from the lobules to a nipple opening during breastfeeding (see figure).

**Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS, Intraductal Carcinoma)** 
A non-invasive breast cancer that begins in the milk ducts of the breast, but has not invaded nearby breast tissue. Also called stage 0 or pre-invasive breast carcinoma.

**Ductal Papilloma** (see Intraductal Papilloma in [I](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/I/index.html)) \
