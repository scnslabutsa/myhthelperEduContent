---

When talking with your spouse or partner think about these key messages: 

* Couples often find it hard to talk about difficult or sad topics. This means that they may shy away from talking about the intense emotions and changes that come with a cancer diagnosis.

* Talk openly and honestly with your spouse or partner. It is also helpful to sensitively listen to your partnerâ€™s thoughts and feelings.

* You should also discuss practical concerns, such as treatment options and changes in routines, and future plans. 

* Consider joining a support group or talking with a trained counselor to help you each cope in your own way.
