**Follow-up Visits**

Your primary care doctor, oncologist or surgeon can help plan your follow-up medical care. At first, your follow-up doctor visits will probably be scheduled for every few months. The longer you have been free of cancer, the less often the appointments are needed. After 5 years, they are typically done about once a year. 
Follow-up visits may include:

* Medical history and physical exam every 4 to 6 months for the first 5 years, then every 12 months.
* Regular mammograms. If you had breast-conserving surgery, you will get a mammogram about 6 months after surgery and radiation are completed, and then at least every year after that. If you had a mastectomy you will still need to have yearly mammograms on the remaining breast.
* Clinical breast exams every year, as part of your periodic health examination.
* Pelvic exam and Pap smear every 12 months (if you are taking tamoxifen).
* Bone density tests every 1 to 2 years (if you are at high risk of osteoporosis).

**Other Screening Tests**

You should continue following your regular health care recommendations:

* Have your annual flu shot.
* Have regular Pap test with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) test every 3 to 5 years or as recommended by your doctor. 
* If you are 50 and older, have regular screening for colon cancer. This may include guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (FOBT) of fecal immunochemical test (FIT), every year; and or flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy every 5 to 10 years. Talk with your doctor about the test that is best for you.
* If you have other health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc. You should continue regular check-ups and follow your doctorâ€™s recommendations. 
* If you have doubts, talk to your doctor about your concerns, and ask him/her who should be responsible for your regular follow-up care. Your medical team should provide a survivorship care plan with advice and recommendations. Ask them about it.

Take advantage of your doctor visits. The main purpose of these visits is to ensure you treatment plan is going as expected and to provide any support you need, such as:

* Talk about ways you may lower your risk of recurrence.
* Talk about any problems you have with medications, such as hormone therapy.
* Discuss any side effects of treatment, such as menopausal symptoms.
* Receive emotional support.
* Give you a time to ask questions and share concerns.
* Discuss medications prescribed by your doctor.
