Government agencies, hospitals, universities, and medical journals and books providing evidence-based information are trustworthy. Too often, other sources can provide misleading or incorrect information. If a source makes claims that are too good to be true, remember—they usually are.

There are many websites, books, and magazines that provide health information to the public, but not all of them are trustworthy.
