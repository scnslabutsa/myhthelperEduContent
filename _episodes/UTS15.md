Health information, in print or online, should come from trusted, credible sources. 

Government agencies, hospitals, universities, and medical journals and books providing evidence-based information are trustworthy. Too often, other sources can provide misleading or incorrect information. If a source makes claims that are too good to be true, rememberâ€”they usually are.

There are many websites, books, and magazines that provide health information to the public, but not all of them are trustworthy. Please click [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=augrvuHd1OM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=augrvuHd1OM) to watch this short educational YouTube video.
