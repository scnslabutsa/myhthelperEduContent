Dry skin can cause itchy skin, so often they two symptoms happen together. 

Your doctor may be able to prescribe you a topical steroid cream. Talk with your healthcare team about how severely and how often you experience dry or itchy skin.

Tips for Managing Dry/Itchy Skin:

* Use a moisturizing cream at least twice a day.
* Apply an oil (such as baby oil) or cream after showering, within 15 minutes.
* Avoid products that irritate skin (soaps, detergents, creams with fragrance/perfume or alcohol).
* Avoid products that scratch or scrub (exfoliate) the skin (sponges, loofas, bath scrubs).
* Shower and bathe with cool or warm water only; hot water can dry the skin even more.
* If your skin is very dry or cracked, use moisturizers that contain the following ingredients: Salicylic acid, urea, ammonium lactate, lactic acid. These ingredients will soften the skin and allow water to be absorbed.
* If your skin is very itchy, use moisturizers that contain menthol, camphor, or pramoxine.
