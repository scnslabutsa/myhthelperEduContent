**Paget Disease of the Breast (Paget Disease of the Nipple)** 
A rare cancer in the skin of the nipple or in the skin closely surrounding the nipple that is usually, but not always, found with an underlying breast cancer (ductal in situ carcinoma or invasive breast cancer). In these cases, the tumor grows from underneath the nipple and breaks out onto the surface of the nipple.

**Palliative Therapy (Palliative Care, Palliation)** 
Care focused on relieving or preventing symptoms (like pain) rather than treating disease.

**Palpable** 
Describes a breast lump or abnormal area that can be felt during a clinical breast exam.

**Palpation** 
To examine, using the hands and fingers.

**PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) Inhibitors** 
A class of targeted therapy drugs that block an enzyme involved in DNA repair (called PARP enzyme).

**Partial Mastectomy (see Lumpectomy in [L](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/L/index.html))** 

**Pathologic Response** 
A measure describing how much of the tumor is left in the breast and lymph nodes after neoadjuvant (before surgery) therapy. The pathologic response gives some information about prognosis. A complete pathologic response means there is no invasive cancer in the tissue removed during breast surgery.

**Pathologist** 
The physician who uses a microscope to study the breast tissue and lymph nodes removed during biopsy or surgery and determines whether or not the cells contain cancer.
 
**Peri-Menopause** 
The time in a woman’s life prior to menopause when menstrual periods become irregular and some menopausal symptoms may begin.

**Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC)** 
A small tube used to deliver medicine to the body through a vein. Instead of being reinserted for each use, a PICC is left in place to allow access for a long period of time (weeks to months).

**Permanent Section** 
A method used in diagnosis. Thin slices of tissue are processed and put on a slide so that a pathologist can study them under a microscope. These sections are of better quality than frozen sections.

**Perometer** 
A device that uses infrared light beams to measure limb volume.

**Personalized Medicine** 
Using information about a person's genes, the tumor’s genes, molecular characteristics of the tumor and the environment to prevent, diagnose and treat disease (such as the use of targeted therapies).This may also be known as precision medicine.

**PET (Positron Emission Tomography)** 
A procedure where a short-term radioactive sugar is given through an IV so that a scanner can show which parts of the body are consuming more sugar. Cancer cells tend to consume more sugar than normal cells do. PET is sometimes used as part of breast cancer diagnosis or treatment, but is not used for breast cancer screening.

**Pharmacogenomics (Pharmacogenetics)** 
The study of the way genes affect a person’s response to drugs to help predict which drugs may offer him/her the most benefit.

**Phenotype** 
A characteristic in a person that results from the interaction between his/her genes and his/her environment.

**Phyllodes Tumor** 
A rare sarcoma (cancer of the soft tissue) in the breast.

**Pituitary Gland** 
A part of the brain that controls growth and other glands in the body, such as the ovaries.
 
**Placebo** 
An inactive medicine sometime used to have a comparison to a new drug in a clinical study. May be called a "sugar pill."

**Pooled Analysis** 
A method for collecting the individual data from a group of studies, combining them into one large set of data and then analyzing the data as if they came from one big study.

**Positron Emission Tomography (see PET)** 

**Postmenopausal Hormone Use (see Menopausal Hormone Therapy in [M](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/M/index.html))** 

**Precision Medicine** 
Using information about a person's genes, the tumor's genes, molecular characteristics of the tumor and the environment to prevent, diagnose and treat disease (such as the use of targeted therapies ). This may also be known as personalized medicine.

**Predictive Factors** 
Factors (such as hormone receptor status) that help guide treatment for a specific cancer case.

**Predispose** 
To make more at risk for a disease.

**Premenopausal  Women** 
Women who have regular menstrual periods.

**Premium (Insurance Premium)** 
The cost of insurance coverage for a certain period of time.

**Preoperative Chemotherapy (see Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in [N](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/N/index.html))** 

**Prevalence Rate** 
The proportion (percentage) of people in a population who have a certain disease, behavior or characteristic at a defined point in time.

**Prevention** 
Steps taken to lower the risk of a disease.

**Primary Chemotherapy (see Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in [N](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/N/index.html))** 

**Primary Tumor** 
The original cancer.
 
**Progesterone** 
A hormone made by the body that is important in menstrual cycles and pregnancy. May be made in a laboratory (called progestin) and used in birth control pills, menopausal hormone therapy and other types of hormone treatment.

**Progesterone Receptor** 
Specific proteins on cells that progesterone hormones attach to. A high number of progesterone receptors on a breast cancer cell often means the cancer cell needs progesterone to grow.

**Progestin** 
Any substance (laboratory-made or natural) that has some or all of the effects of progesterone in the body.

**Prognosis** 
The expected or probable outcome or course of a disease (the chance of recovery).

**Prognostic Factors** 
Factors (such as tumor type, size and grade) that help determine prognosis.

**Progression** 
The growth or spread of cancer, with or without treatment.

**Progression-Free Survival** 
The length of time a person lives with cancer (such as metastatic breast cancer) before the cancer grows or spreads.

**Proliferative** 
Rapidly growing and increasing in number.

**Prophylactic Mastectomy** 
Preventive surgery where one or both breasts are removed in order to prevent breast cancer. When both breasts are removed, the procedure is called bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.

**Prospective Study** 
An observational study that follows people forward in time. See Cohort Study.

**Prosthetic (Breast Prosthetic, Prosthesis)** 
An artificial breast form that can be worn under clothing after a mastectomy.
 
**Protocol** 
An outline or plan for the use of an experimental drug, treatment or procedure in cancer therapy or diagnosis.

**Punch Biopsy** 
Removal of a small circle of skin (with a special instrument called a punch or trephine) to be tested for cancer cells.
