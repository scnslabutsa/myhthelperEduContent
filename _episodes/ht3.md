---

Hormone therapy is often used after surgery (called “adjuvant therapy” that follows the primary treatment) to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back.

Sometimes it is started before surgery (called “neoadjuvant therapy” that is a first step before the main treatment). It is usually used for 5 to 10 years.

Hormone therapy can also be used to treat cancers that have come back after treatment or that have spread to other parts of the body.
