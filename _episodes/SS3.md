**Family and Friends**

You may already have support from your circle of family and friends. Spouses and partners, as well as children, often play key roles in supporting those they love through the tough times of diagnosis and treatment.

**Other Sources**

You may find you also need support from people outside of your existing network. This can be a difficult step, but it is an important one. 

Breast cancer can cause strain within relationships. Some people notice a withdrawal of emotional support from close friends and family members. This means that, at the time when they are needed most, the people close to you may be less supportive than usual. This can happen to anyone, so it is important to be prepared and to seek other sources of support if you need them. 

Even when relationships with family and friends are not strained, other sources of support can be helpful. Fortunately, there are many social support resources including support groups, religious organizations and health care providers.
