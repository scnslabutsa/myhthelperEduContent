**Benign** 
Not cancerous. Does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body.

**Benign Breast Conditions (Benign Breast Disease)** 
Noncancerous conditions of the breast that can result in lumps or other abnormalities. Examples include cysts and fibroadenomas.

**Benign Phyllodes Tumor** 
A rare benign (not cancer) breast condition similar to a fibroadenoma. A lump may be felt, but is usually painless.

**Bilateral Prophylactic Mastectomy** 
Surgery where both breasts are removed to prevent breast cancer from developing.

**Biological Therapy** 
A therapy that targets something specific to the biology of the cancer cell, as opposed to chemotherapy, which attacks all rapidly dividing cells. Often used to describe therapies that use the immune system to fight cancer (immunotherapy). Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an example of a biological or targeted therapy agent.

**Biomarker** 
A substance found in blood, other body fluids or tissues that can be measured and is a sign of disease or another process in the body (normal or abnormal). It also may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease.

**Biopsy** 
Removal of tissue to be tested for cancer cells.

**Bisphosphonates** 
Drugs used to strengthen bones and decrease the rate of bone fractures and pain due to breast cancer metastases to the bone.

**Body Mass Index (BMI)** 
A measure used to estimate body fat. BMI takes into account a person’s height and weight. Calculate your BMI.

**Bone Scan** 
A test done to check for signs of cancer in the bones. A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the bloodstream. It collects in the bones, especially abnormal areas, and is detected by a scanner. Bone scans can show cancer as well as benign bone diseases (like arthritis).

**Boost** 
Additional dose of radiation to the part of the breast that had the tumor.

**BRCA1/BRCA2 Genes (BReast CAncer genes)** 
Genes that help limit cell growth. A mutation (change) in one of these genes increases a person’s risk of breast, ovarian and certain other cancers.

**Brachytherapy** 
A procedure that uses targeted radiation therapy from inside the tumor bed.

**Breast Cancer** 
An uncontrolled growth of abnormal breast cells.

**Breast Cancer Advocacy** 
Influencing targeted audiences to promote the support of breast cancer issues.

**Breast Cancer Survivor** (see Survivor in [S](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/S/index.html)) \

**Breast Conserving Surgery (see Lumpectomy) Breast Density** 
A measure used to describe the relative amounts of fat and tissue in the breasts as seen on a mammogram.
 
**Breast-Specific Gamma Imaging**  (see Nuclear Medicine Imaging of the Breast in [N](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/N/index.html)) \

**Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS®)** 
A system developed by the American College of Radiology to provide a standard way to describe the findings on a mammogram.

**Breast Reconstruction** 
Surgery to restore the look and feel of the breast after mastectomy.

**Breast Self-Examination (BSE)** 
A method that may help women become familiar with the normal look and feel of their breasts. BSE is not recommended as a breast cancer screening tool because it has not been shown to decrease breast cancer death.

**Breast Tomosynthesis (3D Digital Mammography, Digital Tomosynthesis)** 
A tool that uses a digital mammography machine to take multiple two dimensional (2D) X-ray images of the breast. Computer software combines the multiple 2D images into a three dimensional image. Breast tomosynthesis is not a standard breast cancer screening tool at this time.
