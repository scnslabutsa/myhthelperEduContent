* Walk daily. There are so many ways to add walking to your daily routine:

    - When you’re at work, use a bathroom that is in a different building or different floor.
    - Walk during your lunch time.
    - Walk around your neighborhood after dinner.
    - Walk your dog in the morning and before bed; if you don’t have a dog, maybe your neighbor needs help walking their dog.

    - Don’t text your children to come to the table for dinner. Walk to their rooms to tell them.
    - Park farther away from building entrances.
    - If you use the bus, get off one stop earlier.
    - If you need to go somewhere within walking distance, walk  instead of drive.
    - Form a walking club with your co-workers to help you stay motivated to talk during the workday.
    - Wear a pedometer every day so that you see just how much you’re walking. Sometimes just seeing how little or how much you are walking can motivate you to walk more!

* Ride your bike.

* Do some yard work. Mow the grass or pull out weeds; rake leaves instead of using a leaf blower.

* Scrub your bathroom tubs and showers.

* Wash and wax your car.

* Play active games with your kids, like freeze tag or jump rope.

* Take a friend dancing or dance in your own living room.

* Do something while you watch TV. Get light hand weights and do curls, use a stationary bike or treadmill, do squats during commercials.

* Use the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator.
