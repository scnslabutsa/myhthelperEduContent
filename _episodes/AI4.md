title:  Benefits 
---

For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, treatment with aromatase inhibitors (alone or after several years of tamoxifen) lowers the risk of:

* Breast cancer recurrence;
* Breast cancer in the opposite breast; and
* Death form breast cancer.

Among postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors (alone or after tamoxifen) offer the same or slightly greater benefit compared to tamoxifen alone.
