**RAD (dose of radiation)** 
Short for "radiation absorbed dose." This term describes the amount of radiation absorbed by the tissues. One RAD is equal to one centigray. See Centigray.

**Radiation Oncologist** 
A physician specializing in the treatment of cancer using targeted, high energy X-rays.

**Radiation Therapy (Radiotherapy)** 
Treatment given by a radiation oncologist that uses targeted, high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells.

**Radical Mastectomy (Halsted Radical)** 
Surgical removal of the breast, chest muscles and underarm lymph nodes. Used only when the breast tumor has spread to the chest muscles.

**Radiologist** 
A physician who reads and interprets X-rays, mammograms and other scans related to diagnosis or follow-up. Radiologists also perform needle biopsy and wire localization procedures.

**Radiotherapy (see Radiation Therapy) Raloxifene** 
A drug first used to treat osteoporosis and now also used to lower the risk of
breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk.

**Reconstruction (see  Breast Reconstruction in [B](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/B/index.html))** 
 
**Recurrence (Relapse)** 
Return of cancer. Local recurrence is the return of cancer to the same breast or the same side chest wall. Distant recurrence is the return of cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bones or brain. See Metastases.

**Regimen** 
A treatment plan.

**Regional Lymph Nodes** 
In breast cancer, the axillary (in the underarm area) lymph nodes, infraclavicular (under the collarbone) lymph nodes, supraclavicular (above the collarbone) lymph nodes and internal mammary nodes. See Lymph Nodes.

**Regression** 
The shrinking of a tumor.

**Relative Risk** 
A measure used to describe the increase (or decrease) in risk related to a specific risk factor. A relative risk is the ratio of two absolute risks: the numerator is the absolute risk among those with the risk factor and the denominator is the absolute risk among those without the risk factor. A relative risk that is greater than one shows a factor increases risk. A relative risk that is less than one shows a factor decreases risk. And, a relative risk of one shows the factor neither increases nor decreases risk (this means the factor is not likely related to risk of the disease).

**Relative Survival (Relative Survival Rate)** 
A measure used to compare the survival of people who have a certain disease with those who do not at a given time after diagnosis or treatment. The relative survival rate shows whether the disease shortens life. If relative survival is 100 percent at five years after treatment, there is no difference in survival between those who have the disease and those who do not five years after treatment.

**Risk (of disease)** 
Probability (chance) of disease developing in a person during a specified time period.
 
**Risk-Benefit Ratio** 
The relationship between the possible (or expected) side effects and benefits of a treatment or procedure.

**Risk Factor** 
Any factor—from a lifestyle choice (such as diet) to genetics to an environmental exposure (such as radiation)—that increases or decreases a person's risk of developing a certain disease.
