The part of a cell that contains DNA. The DNA information in a person's genes is inherited from both sides of a person’s family.

**Gene Expression** 
Process in which a gene gets turned on in a cell to make RNA and proteins.

**Gene Expression Profiling (see Tumor Profiling in [T](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/T/index.html)) Gene Mutation** 
Any change in the DNA (the information contained in a gene) of a cell. Gene mutations can be harmful, beneficial or have no effect.

**Gene Variant of Uncertain Significance** 
A gene mutation not currently known to increase breast cancer risk.

**General Practitioner (Internist, Physician)**

**Genetic Susceptibility (Genetic Predisposition)** 
An increased likelihood or chance of developing a disease due to specific changes in a person's genes passed on from either parent.

**Genetic Testing** 
Analyzing DNA to look for a gene mutation that may show an increased risk for developing a specific disease.

**Genome** 
The total genetic information of an organism.

**Glandular Tissue (in the breast)** 
The tissue in the breast that includes the milk ducts and lobules.
