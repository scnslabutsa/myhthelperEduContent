**Tamoxifen (Nolvadex)** 
A hormone therapy drug (taken in pill form) used to treat early and advanced stage breast cancers that are hormone receptor-positive. These breast cancers need estrogen to grow. Tamoxifen stops or slows the growth of these tumors by blocking estrogen from attaching to hormone receptor in the cancer cells.

**Targeted Therapy** 
Drug therapies designed to attack specific molecular agents or pathways involved in the development of cancer. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an example of a targeted therapy used to treat breast cancer.

**Tertiles** 
Categories of an exposure (like body weight or exercise) based on three equal parts of the total number of people in the study.

**Therapeutic Touch** 
An integrative or complementary therapy where trained practitioners enter a semi-meditative state and hold their hands just above a person’s body to sense energy imbalances due to illness. Healing energy is then said to transfer to the person.

**Thermography** 
An imaging technique that uses infrared light to measure temperature differences on the surface of the breast. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American College of Radiology do not view thermography as a valuable breast cancer screening method.

**Tissue** 
A group or layer of cells.

**Tomosynthesis (see  Breast Tomosynthesis in [B](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/B/index.html))** 
 
**Total Mastectomy (Simple Mastectomy)** 
Surgical removal of the breast but no other tissue or nodes. Used for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ and, in some cases, breast cancer recurrence. Also used in prophylactic mastectomy.

**Trastuzumab (Herceptin)** 
A drug that is a specially made antibody that targets cancer cells with a lot of the protein called HER2/neu on their surfaces. When attached to the HER2/neu protein, trastuzumab slows or stops the growth of the cancer cells. Trastuzumab is used to treat HER2/neu-positive breast cancer. Herceptin is the brand name for trastuzumab.

**Triple Negative Breast Cancer** 
A breast cancer that is estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor- negative and HER2/neu-negative. These factors limit treatment choices. Most triple negative tumors are basal-like tumors. These breast cancers tend to be aggressive and are more common in African American women.

**Tumor** 
An abnormal growth or mass of tissue that may be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

**Tumor Grade** 
Describes how closely cancer cells look like normal cells. Grade 1 tumors have cells that are slow-growing and look the most like normal cells. Grade 3 tumors have cells that are fast-growing and look very abnormal. Grade 2 tumors fall in between grade 1 and grade 3.

**Tumor Marker** 
A substance found in blood that may be a sign of metastatic breast cancer. Tumor markers are found in both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help indicate metastatic breast cancer treatment activity. The term tumor marker may also be used more broadly to refer to characteristics of tumor cells such as hormone receptors.

**Tumor Profiling (Gene Expression Profiling)** 
Tests that give information about thousands of genes in cancer cells. Specific genes (or combinations of genes) may give information useful in prognosis and in making treatment decisions.

**Two-Step Procedure** 
Biopsy and further surgical treatment done at two separate times.
 
**Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors** 
A class of drugs that target enzymes important for cell functions (called tyrosine- kinase enzymes). These drugs can block tyrosine-kinase enzymes at many points along the cancer growth pathway.
