Constipation is when your bowels move less often and stools become harder to pass. It will feel like you need to move your bowels (go number 2), but can’t. 

Contact your doctor if you haven’t had a bowel movement for 3 days or longer and before starting any kind of treatment for constipation, because some treatments may be harmful to certain people. Your healthcare team will be able to help you choose the best treatment.

Tips to Manage Constipation:

* Eat high-fiber foods. Foods high in fiber include fruit, grains and cereal, beans, nuts, and vegetables. Add these foods to your diet slowly to avoid bloating and gas.
* Drink extra fluids. 8 to 10 cups of liquids such as water, prune juice, warm juices, teas, or hot lemonade throughout the day can be helpful.
* If possible, try to increase your physical activity. Not exercising is one of the most common causes of constipation.
* Only use laxatives as directed by your healthcare team. 
* In addition to laxatives, you can ask your healthcare team about over-the-counter stool softeners, psylilum fiber, enemas, or suppositories.
