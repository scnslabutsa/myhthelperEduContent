title: Muscle Cramps<sup>38,39</sup>
---

Muscle cramps are painful contractions of one or more of your muscles. Talk to your healthcare team about frequent cramping, because your doctor may be able to prescribe a medication that can help you. 

Tips for Managing Muscle Cramps:

* Stretch and massage. Stretch the cramped muscle and gently rub it to help it relax.
* Apply heat or cold. Use a warm towel or heating pad on tense or tight muscles, or take a warm bath. If heat doesn’t work, try applying a cold towel or wrap ice in a towel and gently rub the cramped muscle.

Tips to Prevent Muscle Cramps:

* Stay hydrated. Fluids help your muscles contract and relax, so it’s important to avoid dehydration. A common recommendation is 8-10 cups of clear fluids per day.
* This is especially important after strenuous physical activity or on days you spend a lot of time outdoors.
* Stretch before and after physical activity.
* Stretch before bed if you tend to have cramps at night.
* Light exercise, such as riding a stationary bicycle for a few minutes before bedtime, can also prevent cramps while you’re sleeping.
