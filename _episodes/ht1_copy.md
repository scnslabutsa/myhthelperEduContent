title: How do hormones affect breast cancers? <sup>1</sup>,<sup>2</sup>
---

Some types of breast cancer are affected by hormones in the blood. Hormones are chemical messengers that activate or control certain cells.

*Breast Cancer Types*

* Breast cancers with many hormone receptor cells are called hormone receptor-positive cancers. They can attach to the hormones estrogen (estrogen- positive or ER-positive) and/or progesterone (progesterone positive or PR-positive). For these cancers, high estrogen levels help cancer cells grow and spread. About 75% of patients are diagnosed with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

* Breast cancers with few or no hormone receptor cells are called hormone receptor-negative cancers. They can be estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) and/or progesterone receptor-negative (PR-negative).
