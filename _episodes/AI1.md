title:  How do aromatase inhibitors work? 
---

**Aromatase inhibitors** are drugs that block the activity of an enzyme called aromatase, which the body uses to make estrogen in the ovaries and in other tissues. They are used primarily in postmenopausal women, but can be used in premenopausal women in combination with drugs that suppress ovarian function.
