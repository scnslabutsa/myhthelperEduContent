Children often overhear conversations. They tend to worry more if they feel that important news is being kept from them. As a parent or guardian, you may want to protect your children from distressing news, such as cancer. However, avoiding the topic may confuse children and make them fear a worst-case situation.

It is  important to remember that children share information with each other. The whole family, including your siblings and parents, should work together to decide what and how much to tell the children about a family member’s cancer diagnosis. This can help avoid confusing or misleading information being passed among the children.

As you talk with your children, listen to their concerns and answer their questions to the best of your ability. Here are some tips to help talk with your children about cancer:

* Use the term cancer. It gives your children specific information and reduces confusion and misunderstanding, particularly if they overhear you using the word with others.

* Use age appropriate language. Younger children need simple explanations. A more detailed explanation helps reduce feelings of helplessness and fear for older children.

* Reassure them that cancer is not contagious.

* Let them know it is OK for them to have many different feelings. Explain that you have many of those same feelings, too.

- Be honest when answering questions. It is OK to say, “I don’t know.”

- Try to keep your children’s routines as consistent as possible, but prepare them for the things that will change.

- Provide opportunities for your children to help you so that they feel needed, valued, and helpful. However, don’t burden them with more responsibilities than they can handle.

- Consider joining a support group for families or attending family counseling/therapy.

- Consider practicing the conversation with a trusted loved one who can give you feedback on your tone and choice of words. You will want to be as calm as possible while talking to children about a cancer diagnosis.

- Prepare your children for possible physical changes, such as hair or weight loss, before they happen.

- Explain that, although sometimes you deal with side effects of treatment, it is ultimately working to help you get better and healthy again.

- Let your children know that they are free to ask questions. 

- It is a good idea to let your children’s teachers know what you are going through—especially for younger children. The teachers may be able to help the children cope if they spend most of the day at school.

- Finally, just as your children depend on you, you can depend on them, too. They can be, and probably want to be, a source of support for you. They will want to listen to you, hug you, kiss you and spend time with you. Let them.

- Encourage your whole family to talk with each other, so there is no confusion among the children in the family.
