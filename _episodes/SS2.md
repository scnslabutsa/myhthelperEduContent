Almost everyone who is going through or has been through cancer can benefit from support. 

Support can come in many forms: family, friends, cancer support groups, religious or spiritual groups, online support communities, or one-on-one counselors. What’s best for you depends on your situation and personality. Some people feel safe in peer-support groups or education groups. Others would rather talk in an informal setting, such as church. Others may feel more at ease talking one-on-one with a trusted friend or counselor. Whatever your source of strength or comfort, make sure you have a place to go with your concerns. You need people you can turn to for strength and comfort.

There are many support groups available, see support resources for a list of local support groups. Some resources, such as the American Cancer Society Reach to Recovery program, matches you up with a local volunteer who has had breast cancer. As someone who’s been through the experience, your Reach to Recovery volunteer can answer many of your questions.

The cancer journey can feel very lonely. You don’t have to feel the need to try to deal with everything on your own, and your friends and family may feel shut out if you don’t include them. Let them in, and let in anyone else who you feel may help.

As you go through the different stages of grief and healing, a social support network can help you address the emotional impact of the diagnosis and treatment. Research shows social support has real benefits for breast cancer survivors. Whether it is informal support from family and friends, or more formal support from group or individual therapy, social support can improve your quality of life

Social support may reduce: 

  * Anxiety and stress 
  * Emotional distress and depression 
  * Fatigue 
  * The experience of pain 

Social support may improve: 

  * Mood 
  * Self-image 
  * Ability to cope with stress 
  * Sexual function and enjoyment 
  * Feelings of control 

**Social Support After treatment**

Having social networks can help survivors with recovery and adjusting to life after treatment. One study found that compared to women who were socially isolated, women with social connections (for example, through marriage, close friendships or membership in a religious organization) had: 

  * Fewer physical limitations 
  * Less of a decline in their ability to perform daily activities
