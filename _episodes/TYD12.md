title: Talking with Your Doctor
---

No one knows more about your body than you do. Not your partner, your parents, or even your doctor. 

So when you talk with health care providers about your health, remember that you have valuable information they can use. You know about changes in your body and about any problems you are having. Share that information. Open and honest communication between you and your doctor is one of the best ways to make sure you get the care you need.
