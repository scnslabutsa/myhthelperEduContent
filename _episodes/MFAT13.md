title: Medical Follow-up After Treatment
---

Many women are relieved or excited to be finished with breast cancer treatment, as this may signal a new start in life. At the same time, it can also be a time of worry for women who fear their cancer could come back, or who feel lost without the same level of care from their cancer care team.

Even after you have completed breast cancer treatment, your doctors will want to watch you closely. Itâ€™s very important to go to all of your follow-up appointments. During these visits, your doctors will ask if you are having any problems and may do exams and lab tests or imaging tests to look for signs of cancer or treatment side effects.

Almost any cancer treatment can have side effects. Some might only last for a few days or weeks, but others might last a long time. Some side effects might not even show up until years after you have finished treatment. Visits with your doctor are a good time for you to ask questions and talk about any changes or problems you notice or concerns you have.
