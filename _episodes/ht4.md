title: Importance of completing your hormone therapy treatment
---

The most important benefit of hormone therapy is to reduce the chance of breast cancer returning and the risk of a new cancer developing in the other breast. 

Keep in mind that for your treatment to be effective in lowering your risk of new or returning cancer, it is essential that you take the medicine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. 

People who complete the full course have better survival than those who do not. 

If you miss a dose or two, do not panic. Continue taking your medicine as prescribed.

The length of treatment coupled with side effects often makes it difficult to complete hormone therapy. Although the menopausal symptoms related to hormone therapy can be hard to deal with, there are things you can do that may ease these side effects. If you have side effects, don’t suspend taking your medication; talk with your health care provider about ways to treat them.
