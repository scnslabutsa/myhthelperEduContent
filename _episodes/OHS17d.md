**Symptoms**

Depression is a common, but serious mood disorder. It causes symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities. Let your doctor know if you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks:

* Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood
* Feeling irritable
* Feeling hopeless
* Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy
* Frequent crying
* Loss of motivation to do daily activities
* Decreased ability to concentrate
* Negative thoughts
* Changes in sleep 
* Changes in weight or appetite

**Treatment for Depression**

Depression—even severe depression—can be treated. Treatment usually involves medications, psychological treatment, or a combination of both:

Things You Can Do:

* Try to be active and exercise, even if you don’t really feel like it.
* Try not to isolate yourself; try to spend time with other people.
* Expect your mood to improve gradually, not immediately.
* Get help. Don’t be afraid or embarrassed to talk to someone about your depression, to ask your doctor about treatment options, or to begin treatment for depression.
