title: What is hormone therapy for breast cancer and how does it work?  <sup>1</sup><sup>, </sup><sup>2</sup>
---

Hormone therapy (also called hormonal therapy, hormone treatment, or endocrine therapy) is systemic therapy. That means it reaches cancer cells anywhere in the body, not just the breasts. Hormone therapy is recommended for women with hormone receptor-positive (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) breast cancers, not for women with tumors that are hormone-negative. 

*Ways hormone therapy slows or stops growth of hormone-sensitive tumors*

Hormone therapy slows or stops the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors in two ways:

1. by lowering the amount of estrogen in the body. This can be done by blocking ovarian function (i.e., Zoladex and Lupron); or by blocking estrogen production through drugs called aromatase inhibitors (i.e., Arimidex and Femara and Aromasin); and\
2. by blocking the action of estrogen on breast cancer cells (i.e, Novaldex [tamoxifen] and Evista [raloxifene]).

The hormone therapy a doctor prescribes depends on many factors, including disease characteristics, and if you are pre- or post-menopausal.
