**Cachexia** 
Loss of appetite and weight.

**Calcifications** 
Deposits of calcium in the breast that appear as bright, white spots on a mammogram. Most calcifications are not cancer. However, tight clusters or lines of tiny calcifications (called microcalcifications) can be a sign of breast cancer.

**Cancer** 
General name for over 100 diseases with uncontrolled cell growth.
Cancer Staging (see Staging) Carcinoma in Situ(in Situ Carcinoma)
Condition where abnormal cells are found in the milk ducts or lobules of the breast, but not in the surrounding breast tissue. In situ means "in place." See ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ.
 
**Case-Control Study** 
An observational study that looks at two groups–one with people who already have the outcome of interest (cases), and one with people who do not (controls). For example, the cases may be women with breast cancer and the controls may be cancer-free women. The two groups are then compared to see if any characteristic was more common in the past history of one group compared to the other.

**Case Series** 
A health care provider’s observations of a group of patients who are given a certain type of  treatment.

**Catheter** 
A small tube used to deliver fluids to (or remove them from) the body.

**Centigray  (Centigrays)** 
One centigray describes the amount of radiation absorbed by the body and is equivalent to 1 RAD (radiation absorbed dose).

**Chemoprevention** 
A drug or combination of drugs used to lower the risk of breast cancer in cancer- free women at higher risk.

**Chemotherapy** 
A drug or combination of drugs that kills cancer cells in various ways.

**Clinical Breast Examination (CBE)** 
A physical exam done by a health care provider to check the look and feel of the breasts and underarm for any changes or abnormalities (such as lumps).

**Clinical Trials** 
Research studies that test the benefits of possible new ways to detect, diagnose, treat or prevent disease. People volunteer to take part in these studies.

**Cognitive (function)** 
Mental processes related to understanding, such as reasoning and problem- solving.

**Cohort Study** 
A study that follows a large group of people (a cohort) over time.

**Co-Insurance** (see Co-Payment in [C](/C/index.html)) \
 
**Complementary Therapies (Integrative Therapies)** 
Therapies (such as acupuncture or massage) used in addition to standard medical treatments. Complementary therapies are not used to treat cancer, but they may help improve quality of life and relieve some side effects of treatment or the cancer itself. When complementary therapies are combined with standard medical care, they are often called integrative therapies.

**Computer-assisted detection (CAD)** 
Software developed to help radiologists find suspicious areas on a digital mammogram.
Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT) Scan (see CT Scan) 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI)
A statistical concept that shows there is a 95 percent probability the 'true' measure is found within a range of measures computed from a single study. For example, if the 95% confidence interval for a survival rate is 75 to 90 percent, there is a 95 percent chance the true survival rate falls between 75 and 90 percent.

**Co-Payment (Co-Insurance)** 
In an insurance plan, the portion of medical costs a person must pay (the portion not covered by his/her insurance policy).

**Core Needle Biopsy** 
A needle biopsy that uses a hollow needle to remove samples of tissue from an abnormal area in the breast.

**Co-Survivor** 
A person who lends support to someone diagnosed with breast cancer, from the time of diagnosis through treatment and beyond. Co-survivors may include family members, spouses or partners, friends, health care providers and colleagues.

**CT Scan (Computerized Tomography Scan, Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT) Scan)** 
A series of pictures created by a computer linked to an X-ray machine. The scan gives detailed internal images of the body.

**Cumulative Risk** 
The sum of a person's chances of developing a disease (like breast cancer) over the course of a lifetime (usually defined as birth up to age 85). For example, the cumulative (lifetime) risk of breast cancer for women is about 1 in 8 (or about 12 percent). This means for every 8 women, one will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime (up to age 85).

**Cyst** 
A fluid-filled sac.

**Cytopathologist** 
A pathologist who specializes in looking at individual cells. A cytopathologist is needed to interpret the results of fine needle aspiration.

**Cytotoxic** 
Toxic, or deadly, to cells (cell killing). Often used to describe chemotherapy. Top of Document
