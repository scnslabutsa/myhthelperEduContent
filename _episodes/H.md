**H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) Staining** 
A laboratory test that gives color to cells so cell structures can be identified.

**HER2/neu (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2, erbB2)** 
A protein involved in cell growth and survival that appears on the surface of some breast cancer cells. HER2/neu-negative breast cancers have little or no HER2/neu protein. HER2/neu-positive breast cancers have a lot of HER2/neu protein.
HER2/neu-positive tumors can be treated with the targeted therapy drug trastuzumab (Herceptin).

**Herceptin (see Trastuzumab in [T](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/T/index.html))** 

**Hereditary (see Genetic in [G](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/G/index.html))** 
 
**Homeopathy (Homeopathic Medicine)** 
A medical system based on a belief that “like cures like.” Natural substances are specially prepared in small amounts to restore health. These substances cause symptoms similar to the condition they are meant to treat in healthy people.
There are limited data on the safety of these substances.

**Hormones** 
Chemicals made by certain glands and tissues in the body, often in response to signals from the pituitary gland or the adrenal gland. Hormones have specific effects on specific target organs and tissues. Examples include estrogen and progesterone. Hormones can also be made in a laboratory.

**Hormone Receptors** 
Specific proteins on cells that hormones attach to. A high number of hormone receptors on a breast cancer cell often means the cancer cell needs the hormone to grow.

**Hormone Receptor Status** 
Shows whether or not a breast cancer needs hormones to grow. A hormone receptor-positive (estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive) cancer needs hormones to grow. A hormone receptor-negative (estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-negative) cancer does not need hormones to grow. See Hormone    Receptor.

**Hormone Replacement Therapy (see Menopausal Hormone Therapy in [M](/{{page.root}}/myhthelperEduContent/M/index.html))**  

**Hormone Therapy (Endocrine Therapy, Endocrine  Manipulation)** 
Treatment that works by keeping cancer cells with hormone receptors from getting the hormones they need to grow.

**Hyperplasia (Usual and Atypical Hyperplasia)** 
A benign (not cancer) breast condition where breast cells are growing rapidly (proliferating). Although hyperplasia is not breast cancer, it increases the risk of breast cancer. In usual hyperplasia, the proliferating cells look normal under a microscope. In atypical hyperplasia, the proliferating cells look abnormal.
