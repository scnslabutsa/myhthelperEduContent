We need support from others. Cancer diagnosis affects people other than you in many ways. 

Sometimes loved ones have fears or concerns that they may not be expressing to you, or maybe you have feelings that you are not sharing with them. Other times, you do share your feelings, but they just don’t seem to understand. Cancer changes the lives of each person in a relationship, and both require support. 

Talking about cancer is challenging. If you have trouble talking with your partner, ask someone else to help. This might be your doctor or another member of your health care team, a friend or another family member. You may be interested in support groups for couples. You can find out about these from your health care team. Listening to and talking to others who are also going through this experience can be very helpful. You can discuss anything from the most general topics (like nutrition) to the most personal topics (like sex).

Finding support from others will not only help you—it could also help your partner.
