Diarrhea is frequent, loose, or watery bowel movements. 

Uncontrolled diarrhea can lead to dehydration (fluid loss), weight loss, poor appetite, and weakness, so it’s very important to contact your healthcare team if your diarrhea does not get better. 

Tips to Manage Diarrhea:

* Avoid high-fiber foods because they can make diarrhea worse. Foods high in fiber include fruit, grains and cereal, beans, nuts, and vegetables.

* Avoid greasy, fried, spicy or very sweet foods because they can make diarrhea worse.

* Drink plenty of clear, non-carbonated (no sodas!) liquids during the day. Drink your liquids at room temperature.

* Drink and eat high-sodium (salt) foods like broths, soups, sports drinks, crackers, and pretzels. 

* Drink and eat high-potassium foods like fruit juices, sports drinks, potatoes with the skin, and bananas.

* Eat small, frequent meals and snacks throughout the day.
