Diarrhea is frequent, loose, or watery bowel movements. 

Uncontrolled diarrhea can lead to dehydration (fluid loss), weight loss, poor appetite, and weakness, so itâ€™s very important to contact your healthcare team if your diarrhea does not get better. 

Tips to Manage Diarrhea:

* Avoid high-fiber foods because they can make diarrhea worse. Foods high in fiber include fruit, grains and cereal, beans, nuts, and vegetables.

* Avoid greasy, fried, spicy or very sweet foods because they can make diarrhea worse.

* Drink plenty of clear, non-carbonated (no sodas!) liquids during the day. Drink your liquids at room temperature.

* Drink and eat high-sodium (salt) foods like broths, soups, sports drinks, crackers, and pretzels. 

* Drink and eat high-potassium foods like fruit juices, sports drinks, potatoes with the skin, and bananas.

* Eat small, frequent meals and snacks throughout the day.
